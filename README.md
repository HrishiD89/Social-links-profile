# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

Also, I didn't get any figma or any other design file to accurately match the original design, and for my one, I tried my best to calculate the sizes of the elements by analyzing them with my naked eye.
